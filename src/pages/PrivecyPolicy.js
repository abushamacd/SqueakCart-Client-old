            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>How do you get my consent?</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
              When you provide personal information to complete a transaction,
              verify your credit card, place an order, arrange for a delivery or
              return a purchase, we imply that you consent to our collecting it
              and using it for that specific reason only.
            </p>
            <p>
              If we ask for your personal information for a secondary reason,
              like marketing, we will either ask you directly for your expressed
              consent or provide you with an opportunity to say no.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>How do I withdraw my consent?</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
              If after you opt-in, you change your mind, you may withdraw your
              consent for us to contact you, for the continued collection, use
              or disclosure of your information, at any time, by contacting us,
              by using our contact form or contact mail.

                <u>SECTION 3 – DISCLOSURE</u>
              </strong>
            </p>
            <p>
              We may disclose your personal information if we are required by
              law to do so or if you violate our Terms of Service.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>
                <u>SECTION 4 – THIRD-PARTY SERVICES</u>
              </strong>
            </p>
            <p>
              In general, the third-party providers used by our store will only
              collect, use and disclose your information to the extent necessary
              to allow them to perform the services they provide to us.
            </p>
            <p>
              However, certain third-party service providers, such as payment
              gateways and other payment transaction processors have their own
              privacy policies in respect to the information we are required to
              provide to them for your purchase-related transactions.
            </p>
            <p>
              For these providers, we recommend that you read their privacy
              policies so you can understand the manner in which your personal
              information will be handled by these providers.
            </p>
            <p>
              In particular, remember that certain providers may be located in
              or have facilities that are located a different jurisdiction than
              either you or us. So if you elect to proceed with a transaction
              that involves the services of a third-party service provider, then
              your information may become subject to the laws of the
              jurisdiction(s) in which that service provider or its facilities
              are located.
            </p>
            <p>
              As an example, if you are located in the United Kingdom and your
              transaction is processed by a payment gateway located in the
              United States, then your personal information used in completing
              that transaction may be subject to disclosure under United States
              legislation.
            </p>
            <p>

              third-party website or application, you are no longer governed by

              shipped directly from our local suppliers and around the world to
              offer you the best quality and optimum price. Many items will
              arrive within 3-5 working days, however please allow 7-20 working
              days for delivery. Please do not panic if it does not show up
              immediately, itâ€™s on its way ðŸ™‚

              other. So, donâ€™t panic if you donâ€™t receive all of your items at
              onceâ€¦they are on their way to you. ðŸ™‚

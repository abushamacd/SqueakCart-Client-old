                Received by us within 14 days of item delivery. If the items are

              Once your return is received and inspected, we will send you an
              email to notify you that we have received your returned item. We
              will also notify you of the approval of your refund. Then your
              refund will be processed, and a credit will automatically be
              applied to your credit card or original method of payment, within
              a certain amount of days.

              If you haven’t received a refund yet, first check your bank
              account again. Then contact your credit card company, it may take
              some time before your refund is officially posted. Next, contact
              your bank. There is often some processing time before a refund is
              posted. You will be responsible for paying for your own shipping
              costs for returning your item. Shipping costs are non-refundable.
              If you receive a refund, the cost of return shipping will be
              deducted from your refund. Depending on where you live, the time
              it may take for your exchanged product to reach you may vary.
